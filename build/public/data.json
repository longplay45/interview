Essentially, each time a new reference to an object is created, its count increases; and whenever a reference goes out of scope or is deleted, the count decreases. When the reference count reaches zero, Python automatically removes the object from memory to free up space for other objects."

It's often expressed as:\n\nP(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n\nWhere:\n- P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that we know B has happened. This is called the posterior probability.\n- P(B|A) is the probability of observing evidence B if event A were true. This is called the likelihood.\n- P(A) is our initial belief about the likelihood of event A happening before considering any evidence.\n- P(B) represents the overall chance of observing evidence B regardless of whether event A occurs or not."

It depends on two things: the average (mean) and spread (standard deviation). Most values are close to the average, while very different values become less frequent as they get further away from the average. This distribution is popular in machine learning because of its useful math properties and ability to model many real-world situations."
